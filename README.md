# Metro-Route-Planner
Developed a Java-based Metro Route Planner that enables users to find the best route based on both time and 
distance metrics between two stations in the Hyderabad Metro network, offering the most efficient travel options. 
It utilizes graph data structures and algorithms like Dijkstra, breadth-first search and depth-first search to find the 
optimal path between the source station and the destination station.
